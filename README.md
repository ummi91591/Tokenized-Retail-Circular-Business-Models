# Tokenized Retail Circular Business Models

A blockchain-based system built on Stacks using Clarity smart contracts to enable and incentivize circular economy practices in retail businesses.

## Overview

This system provides a comprehensive framework for implementing circular business models in retail through five interconnected smart contracts:

1. **Business Verification Contract** - Validates and manages circular economy retailers
2. **Product Lifecycle Contract** - Tracks circular product journeys through their entire lifecycle
3. **Value Retention Contract** - Maximizes product value retention through circular economy principles
4. **Waste Elimination Contract** - Minimizes retail waste generation and incentivizes reduction efforts
5. **Customer Engagement Contract** - Promotes circular consumption patterns and rewards sustainable behavior

## Key Features

### Business Verification
- Retailer registration and verification system
- Circular economy scoring mechanism
- Verification status tracking
- Admin controls for business approval

### Product Lifecycle Tracking
- Complete product journey documentation
- Stage-by-stage tracking (creation, distribution, use, end-of-life)
- Material composition recording
- Sustainability scoring
- Location and handler tracking

### Value Retention
- Initial product value assessment
- Value retention activity tracking
- Depreciation rate management
- Circular economy value calculations
- Performance metrics and reporting

### Waste Elimination
- Waste generation and elimination tracking
- Multiple waste type categorization
- Elimination method documentation
- Reward system for waste reduction
- Business-level waste statistics

### Customer Engagement
- Customer registration and profile management
- Sustainable action tracking and rewards
- Points-based incentive system
- Engagement level progression (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum)
- Reward redemption system

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Contract Interactions

Customer Engagement
\`\`\`

### Data Flow
1. Businesses register and get verified
2. Products are created and tracked through lifecycle stages
3. Value retention activities are recorded
4. Waste elimination efforts are documented
5. Customers engage with sustainable actions and earn rewards

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- Node.js for testing

### Deployment
1. Deploy contracts in the following order:
    - business-verification.clar
    - product-lifecycle.clar
    - value-retention.clar
    - waste-elimination.clar
    - customer-engagement.clar

2. Initialize contract owner permissions
3. Set up initial business verification parameters

### Usage Examples

#### Register a Business
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .business-verification register-business "EcoRetail Store")
\`\`\`

#### Create a Product
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .product-lifecycle create-product
u1
"Sustainable T-Shirt"
"Clothing"
(list "organic-cotton" "recycled-polyester")
u85)
\`\`\`

#### Record Customer Action
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .customer-engagement record-sustainable-action "recycle" (some u1))
\`\`\`

## Circular Economy Principles

### Design for Circularity
- Products designed for longevity, repairability, and recyclability
- Material selection prioritizing renewable and recycled content
- Modular design enabling component reuse

### Value Retention Strategies
- Repair and refurbishment programs
- Product-as-a-Service models
- Take-back and recycling programs
- Sharing and rental platforms

### Waste Elimination
- Zero waste to landfill goals
- Closed-loop material flows
- Industrial symbiosis opportunities
- Packaging optimization

### Customer Engagement
- Education on circular practices
- Incentives for sustainable behavior
- Community building around sustainability
- Transparency in impact measurement

## Testing

Run the test suite using Vitest:

\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

Tests cover:
- Contract deployment and initialization
- Business registration and verification
- Product lifecycle tracking
- Value retention calculations
- Waste elimination recording
- Customer engagement flows
